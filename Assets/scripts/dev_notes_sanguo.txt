two ways to create global grid:
1. use terraingrid and set global=true
This will create mesh for the whole terrain by create mesh triangle for each grid

2. use terrainboard.cs
which will create mesh for the whole terrain using prefab
the prefab is created by saving mesh runtime created in terraingrid.cs
